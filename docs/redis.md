# Redis

Redis is an in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker.

## Configuration

The Redis service is configured in the `docker-compose.yml` file. It is protected by a password, which can be set using the `REDIS_PASSWORD` environment variable in the `.env` file.
